# NetBox LibreNMS Plugin Bulk Sync Script

Automates the bulk synchronization of network device data from LibreNMS to NetBox using the [netbox-librenms-plugin](https://github.com/bonzo81/netbox-librenms-plugin). This script processes multiple sites and devices automatically, syncing interfaces, cables, IP addresses, and intelligently setting primary IPs.

## üéØ What This Does

Instead of manually clicking through the LibreNMS plugin UI for each device:
1. Click "Refresh Interfaces" ‚Üí Select all ‚Üí Click "Sync"
2. Click "Refresh Cables" ‚Üí Select all ‚Üí Click "Sync"
3. Click "Refresh IP Addresses" ‚Üí Select all ‚Üí Click "Sync"
4. Manually select and set primary IP

This script does all of that **automatically** for every device at specified sites.

**Time savings:** ~5-7 minutes per device ‚Üí ~3 minutes for an entire site

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **NetBox** (tested on v3.6+) with the [netbox-librenms-plugin](https://github.com/bonzo81/netbox-librenms-plugin) installed
- **LibreNMS** configured and monitoring your devices
- **Python 3.8+**

### Required Permissions
The NetBox user account (for both web login and API token) needs:
- `dcim.view_device` - View devices
- `dcim.change_device` - Update device primary IP
- `ipam.view_ipaddress` - View IP addresses
- Access to the LibreNMS plugin interface

### NetBox API Token
Generate an API token in NetBox:
1. Log into NetBox
2. Click your username (top right) ‚Üí "API Tokens"
3. Click "Add Token"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Bulk Sync Script")
5. Select the required permissions above
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

## üöÄ Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netbox-librenms-bulk-sync.git
cd netbox-librenms-bulk-sync

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your NetBox credentials
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env` with your NetBox details:
```bash
NETBOX_URL=http://your-netbox-instance:8080
NETBOX_TOKEN=your_api_token_from_netbox
NETBOX_USERNAME=your_username
NETBOX_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Configure Sites to Sync

Edit the `target_sites` list in `manual_sync.py` (around line 471):
```python
target_sites = [
    "your-site-slug",    # Must match NetBox site slug (lowercase, hyphenated)
    "another-site",
]
```

**Note:** Site names should match your NetBox site **slugs** (not display names). Find these in NetBox at: Organization ‚Üí Sites ‚Üí [Your Site] ‚Üí Slug field.

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Load environment variables and run
export $(cat .env | xargs)
python manual_sync.py
```

### Docker Usage (Optional)

If you prefer to run in a container:
```bash
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  python:3.11-slim \
  bash -c "cd /app && pip install -r requirements.txt && python manual_sync.py"
```

## üîß How It Works

The script uses **two authentication methods** because the LibreNMS plugin has different requirements:

### 1. Session-Based Login (Username/Password)
- Used to interact with the LibreNMS Plugin web UI
- Scrapes HTML forms using BeautifulSoup
- Triggers refresh/sync actions via POST requests
- **Why:** The plugin doesn't expose an API for these actions

### 2. Token-Based API (API Token)
- Used to query devices via NetBox REST API
- Sets primary IP addresses
- **Why:** Standard NetBox API for data operations

## üìä What Gets Synced

For each device, the script syncs:

### Interfaces
- All physical and virtual interfaces
- Interface names, types, MAC addresses
- Enabled/disabled status
- Handles pagination (50 interfaces per page)

### Cables
- CDP/LLDP discovered connections
- Links to neighboring devices
- Creates cable objects in NetBox

### IP Addresses
- All IPv4/IPv6 addresses discovered on interfaces
- Assigns addresses to correct interfaces

### Primary IP Selection
Intelligently selects the primary IP by preferring (in order):
1. IP on management interfaces: `Vlan1`, `vlan1`, `mgmt0`, `Management0`, `lo0`, `Loopback0`
2. First available IP if no management interface found

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Could not authenticate to NetBox"
- Check your `NETBOX_USERNAME` and `NETBOX_PASSWORD`
- Verify the user has permissions to log into the web interface
- Check `NETBOX_URL` is correct and accessible

### "Failed to fetch devices from NetBox API"
- Check your `NETBOX_TOKEN` is valid
- Verify token has required permissions (`dcim.view_device`, etc.)
- Check `NETBOX_URL` points to your NetBox instance
- Ensure NetBox API is accessible from where you're running the script

### "No devices found for site"
- Verify site slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check devices have role='switch' in NetBox
- Confirm devices are assigned to the correct site

### "No sync form found"
- Device may not exist in LibreNMS
- Check LibreNMS plugin is installed and configured in NetBox
- Verify device has been discovered in LibreNMS

### "Pagination stops early"
- Normal behavior if device has fewer interfaces than expected
- Check logs for actual interface count discovered

### Import Errors
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 psycopg2-binary
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Credentials Storage
- **Never commit `.env` file to version control**
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `.env`
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production

### API Token Permissions
- Use the **minimum required permissions**
- Create a dedicated service account for automation
- Rotate tokens periodically

### Network Access
- Run script from a trusted network or management subnet
- Consider using SSH tunnels if running remotely
- Ensure NetBox uses HTTPS in production
